# 🧠 VC Tracker (India)

This is my ongoing build — a project where I'm tracking, analysing, and visualising **venture capital investments in India**.  
This is me learning how India’s VC system actually moves — foreign & domestic money, who’s backing what, and how it all connects.

## ⚙️ What’s working right now

- [x] MongoDB set up with test data  
- [x] Flask backend serving API
- [x] Nginx + Gunicorn + systemd (keeps it alive forever)
- [x] React frontend hosted on Cloudflare Pages  
- [x] Connected frontend ↔ backend  
- [x] Started digging into India’s VC ecosystem (foreign + local dynamics)

## 🧩 Next steps

### Backend
- [ ] Add API keys / route protection  
- [ ] Add filters (by fund name, country, year, etc.)  
- [ ] Create endpoints for analysis (top funds, sectors, trends)  
- [ ] Clean and expand DB beyond the list  
- [ ] Add background tasks for scraping more data  

### Frontend
- [ ] Make a dashboard instead of plain tables  
- [ ] Add simple search + filters  
- [ ] Add charts for foreign vs domestic flow  
- [ ] Give it a proper design (modern, minimal, style)

### Vision
- [ ] Turn this into my first real application to help others
- [ ] Write about VC patterns, India’s funding climate, and how tech meets capital

## 📍 What this project really is

This is my lab.  
I’m using it to:
- learn how venture capital actually works in India,
- and build something real enough to be worth improving every week.
